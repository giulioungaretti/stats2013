      "   2) Does the fit reproduce the input numbers well (include the uncertainties in your\n",

      "      see, if you understand every feature of the distributions shown, and if you are\n",

      "  \n",

      "  \n",
      "   5) Find the line where the random points for the line are generated, and add a\n",
