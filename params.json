Although there are no obvious global trends, we  found  evidence for different correlations when grouping the countries by economic performance or region.\r\n\r\nA stronger correlation is found when using k-means clustering instead of manual grouping by  by economic performance or region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### IPython notebooks:\r\nData munching notebook  for the analysis of the data.\r\n\r\n[**Data munching and correlation hunt**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/giulioungaretti/stats2013/master/Project2/Data_munching_final.ipynb)\r\n\r\n[**Clustering and Geographical Visualization**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/giulioungaretti/stats2013/master/Project2/Clustering.ipynb)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
